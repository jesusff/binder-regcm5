Follow these commands to enable this environment once automamba installed it in you computer:

```bash
conda deactivate                 # (base) disappears from the prompt
source ~/automamba/bin/activate  # (base) comes back to the prompt
conda activate regmc5            # (regcm5) becomes the current environment
```

These commands will need to be issued on any new terminal.
